All projects from my Udemy course: [Lua Programming and Game Development with Love2D](https://www.udemy.com/lua-love)

There are three complete games available, all of which are free for you to use however you like:

1. **Button Clicker** - Whack-A-Mole style game where you must click the button onscreen (which changes position on each click) as quickly as possible in the given amount of time. Handles basic drawing of shapes, coloring, mouse input, real-world timing, keeping score, and simple gamestate for the menu.

2. **Zombie Shooter** - Top-down shooter where you must survive a horde of zombies by shooting them with the mouse. Difficulty increases as time passes. Utilizes sprite drawing, keyboard input, classes (in the form of tables), sprite-rotation, path finding, dynamic generation of objects, and basic collisions.

3. **Coin Collector** - Platformer where you must collect all coins in the level as quickly as possible. Uses the Love2D physics engine (based on Box2D), animations, importing levels from Tiled, and saving/loading high score to a local file.

The projects in this repository will be kept up-to-date with any changes or additions made within the course.
